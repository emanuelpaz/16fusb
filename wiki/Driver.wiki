= Driver =

For communication between a USB device and the host computer, obviously, we need an application and a driver on the operating system to interface with this device. In the 16FUSB case, the driver used for both Windows and Linux is the libusb. The libusb is a driver/library that provides access to USB devices for user-level applications. With libusb is possible to exchange messages between your application and the USB hardware without the need to write a specific driver for your device. Its API is very straightforward and easy to use. Don't miss http://www.libusb.org/  to understand more about the project.
 

The driver installation in Windows environment must meet the following steps:

 * Install the filter driver libusb -win32-filter-devel-xxxx.exe (the version of the filter driver must match the version of device driver).
 * Install the device driver of the 16FUSB with the same version of the filter driver.
 * Copy the include file 'lusb0_usb.h' (found in the device driver package) into the Microsoft SDK's include directory (optional, but recommended).
 * Copy the file 'libusb.lib' (also found in the device driver package) into libs directory of your IDE (optional, but recommended).
